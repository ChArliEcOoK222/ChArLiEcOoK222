Hi 👋 My name is Charlie Cook
=============================

Software Developer
------------------

As an individual with a profound passion for exploring the intersections between technology, science, and human behaviour, my journey has been driven by a relentless curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning. My technical journey began with a fascination for programming, leading me to become proficient in Python. Over time, I've developed a keen interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), constantly seeking to understand and contribute to this rapidly evolving domain. My enthusiasm for AI extends to its potential to revolutionise various industries, particularly through data-driven insights and innovations. In addition to my technical pursuits, I hold a deep passion for psychology, which fuels my curiosity about human behaviour and cognition. I am particularly intrigued by the dynamic relationship between AI and the life sciences, and I am dedicated to discovering and expanding the synergies between these fields. My goal is to bridge the gap between AI and science, leveraging data to uncover new solutions and advance our understanding of the world. I thrive on working with complex data sets and am passionate about the stories that data can tell. Whether it’s through developing algorithms, analysing trends, or applying AI to solve real-world problems, I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact.
